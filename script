Duration: 6–8 minutes
Tone: Friendly, curious, and productive

[0:00 – 0:10] Hook

(B-roll: fast typing, scattered notebooks, quick zoom on messy desk)
Voice (energetic):
“Are your study notes a total mess? What if AI could take care of them for you — automatically!”

(Cut to screen: glowing ChatGPT + Notion icons appear with a soft “whoosh” sound.)

[0:10 – 0:40] Intro

Voice (friendly):

[0:40 – 2:00] Step 1 — Extract Notes with ChatGPT

(Screen recording: ChatGPT interface open, user pastes lecture text)
Voice (teaching tone):
“Let’s start with ChatGPT. Copy your lecture notes or article and ask:

‘Summarize this in 5 bullet points for quick review.’

In seconds, ChatGPT extracts the key ideas and presents them neatly.”

(B-roll: text condenses into short bullet points)

Voice:
“You can tweak the prompt for different needs — try:

‘Highlight only definitions and formulas,’
or
‘Simplify for a first-year biology student.’

That flexibility means you can build personalized study summaries without rewriting a single line.”

(Transition: fade into ChatGPT output zoom-in, glowing outline effect around bullet list)

[2:00 – 3:00] Step 2 — Create Notion AI Templates

(B-roll: switching to Notion app, showing a blank workspace)
Voice (instructional tone):
“Next, let’s organize this inside Notion. Create a new page template and name it Lecture Notes Automation.

Add a few sections like:

Topic

Summary

Key Terms

Insights

References”

(B-roll: typing these headings inside Notion)

Voice:
“Now, paste your ChatGPT summary into the right section.
Ask Notion AI to expand each bullet into short, clear paragraphs.

Within seconds, your AI-generated notes are clean, readable, and ready to review — no formatting headaches!”

(Transition: swipe effect revealing before/after of messy vs clean notes)

[3:00 – 4:30] Step 3 — Connect the Workflow

Voice (enthusiastic):
“Here’s where it gets powerful — let’s automate the connection.

You can use Zapier, Make.com, or the Notion API to send ChatGPT summaries directly into Notion pages.

Every time you paste new notes into ChatGPT, your Notion database updates automatically.”

(On-screen text: “No copy-paste. No clutter.”)

Voice:
“You can even tag notes by subject or add timestamps — so your study material stays searchable and perfectly categorized.”

(B-roll: animated arrows flowing between ChatGPT → Notion, showing notes updating live)

[4:30 – 5:30] Step 4 — Bonus: Auto Daily Summaries

(B-roll: Notion dashboard showing daily summaries auto-updating)
Voice (calm, helpful tone):
“Here’s a bonus tip — Notion AI can summarize your entire day’s learning for you.

Just create a Daily Summary page and say:

‘Summarize today’s new notes into three key lessons.’

Notion AI will instantly generate a short recap — perfect for quick reviews, reflection logs, or exam preparation.”

(B-roll: AI text animating into ‘3 Key Takeaways’ boxes)
