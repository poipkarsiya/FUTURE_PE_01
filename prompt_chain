If you’ve ever struggled with messy notes, long lectures, or staying organized, this workflow is going to change your game.”

🧰 Section 1: What You’ll Need

Say you’ve got a big chunk of lecture text — messy, long, and impossible to study from.
You can copy that text and paste it straight into ChatGPT.”

[Tone: energetic]
“Then, use a prompt like this:

‘Summarize this text into bullet points with headings, key concepts, and short definitions.’

And boom — within seconds, ChatGPT turns that huge block of text into clean, organized study notes.”

[Tone: friendly, conversational]
“You can even ask it to format your notes as flashcards, question-and-answer sets, or key takeaways for revision.
It’s like having a super-fast note-taking assistant who never complains.”
[pause 1s]

[Tone: teaching + calm]

“Pretty amazing, right? [pause 1s]
You could literally upload your lecture every day and have it waiting in Notion by the time you wake up.”
